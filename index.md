# About

The Parallel Ice Sheet Model (PISM) is an open-source modelling framework for ice sheets and glaciers. It is parallel, thermodynamically-coupled and capable of high
resolution. PISM has been [widely adopted as a tool for doing science](/publications/) for about twenty years now. The latest stable release is [`PISM v2.1`](https://github.com/pism/pism/releases).

PISM is jointly developed at the [University of Alaska, Fairbanks (UAF)](http://www.uaf.edu/) and the [Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/). UAF developers are based in the [Glaciers Group](https://glaciers.gi.alaska.edu) at the [UAF Geophysical Institute](https://www.gi.alaska.edu). For more about the team see the [developers team](/team/) page.

Development of PISM is supported by NASA grants 20-CRYO2020-0052 and 80NSSC22K0274 and NSF grant OAC-2118285.
