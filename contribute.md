## Contribution workflow

In summary: documentation and code contributions are preferred via **pull requests** to [https://github.com/pism/pism](https://github.com/pism/pism).

1. [Fork PISM's repository](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)
1. Create a branch that will contain your changes
1. Implement proposed changes
    * Make changes to the code or documentation (or both)
    * Test your changes
    * Add verification or regression tests (optional but *strongly encouraged*)
    * Update documentation, if necessary
    * Update the change log ``CHANGES.rst``. If your contribution contains a bug fix, please describe the bug and its effects

1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request) and make sure to [allow edits from maintainers](https://help.github.com/en/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork)

If you are planning a large contribution we encourage you to open an **issue** at [https://github.com/pism/pism/issues](https://github.com/pism/pism/issues) or e-mail us at <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">{{ site.author.email }}</a> and interact with us frequently to ensure that your effort is well-directed.

## Bug reporting

Please see the [issues](https://github.com/pism/pism/issues) to check if someone already found a similar bug. You can post an issue there, and label it as a bug, if it is new. Alternatively, send a report by e-mail to <a href="mailto:{{ site.author.email }}">{{ site.author.email }}</a>.

Please include the following information in all bug-reports and questions about particular PISM's behavior:
