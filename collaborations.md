# Collaborations

* [The SeaRISE assessment process](https://web.archive.org/web/20220119171826/http://websrv.cs.umt.edu/isis/index.php/SeaRISE_Assessment) in the US plans to contribute model-based estimates of century-scale sea level changes from ice sheet and ice shelf dynamics to the IPCC AR5 report in 2013 
* [ice2sea](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/226375) is a European effort which is somewhat comparable to SeaRISE
* [The CliC (Climate and Cryosphere) project](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/) is one of the core projects of the [World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/), serving as the focal point for climate science related to the cryosphere, its variability and change, and interaction with the broader climate system

# Model intercomparisons (MIPs)

* [EISMINT](https://web.archive.org/web/20210924220157/http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/eismint.html) (European Ice Sheet Modeling INiTiative) is a past intercomparison effort to test and compare existing numerical shallow ice-sheet, ice-shelf, and glacier models as they were run by several groups worldwide
* [ISMIP](https://web.archive.org/web/20220120193645/http://homepages.vub.ac.be/~phuybrec/ismip.html) (Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project) continues intercomparison, including less-shallow and Stokes models ([ISMIP-HOM](https://frank.pattyn.web.ulb.be/ismip/welcome.html)) and rapid sliding events ([ISMIP-HEINO](http://www.pik-potsdam.de/~calov/heino.html))
* [MISMIP](http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip/welcome.html) (Marine Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project) is an intercomparison of flowline (one horizontal dimension) marine ice sheet models
* [MISMIP3D](http://homepages.ulb.ac.be/~fpattyn/mismip3d/welcome.html) is an [ice2sea](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/226375)-sponsored intercomparison of marine ice sheet models in two horizontal dimensions
* [MISMIP+](https://web.archive.org/web/20211127110213/https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/activities/targeted/153-misomip/1412-mismip-plus) is part of the [CliC](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/) initiative and examines marine ice-sheet dynamics in two horizontal dimensions with strong buttressing
* [MISOMIP](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/mips/misomip) (Marine Ice Sheetâ€“Ocean Model Intercomparison Project) is a community effort under the [CliC](http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/) project, aimed at better quantifying sea-level change induced by increased mass loss from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), particularly the Amundsen Sea region. It is meanwhile in its second stage    
* [PLISMIP-ANT](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-9-881-2015) (Pliocene Ice Sheet Modeling Intercomparison Project for Antarctica) investigates the nature and behaviour of the Antarctic Ice Sheet during the late-Pliocene warm  period
* [ABUMIP](http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/wiki/index.php?title=ABUMIP-Antarctica) (Antarctic BUttressing Model Intercomparison Project)
* [LARMIP](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/earth-system-analysis/models/larmip) (Linear Antarctic Response to basal melting Model Intercomparison Project) applies a linear response theory approach to 16 state-of-the-art ice sheet models to estimate the Antarctic ice sheet
  contribution from basal ice shelf melting within the 21st century
* [SHMIP](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-glaciology/article/shmip-the-subglacial-hydrology-model-intercomparison-project/AA648F9E8B0056A4625531C731AE564D) (Subglacial Hydrology Model Intercomparison Project) aims to provide a set of benchmark experiments tailored to compare existing and future subglacial hydrologic models
* [initMIP](http://www.climate-cryosphere.org/wiki/index.php?title=InitMIP) (initial state Model Intercomparison Project), as part of the the [CliC](https://www.climate-cryosphere.org/) project, aims to compare, evaluate, and improve ice sheet model initialization procedures and estimate their impact on century-scale simulations of the ice sheets of Greenland and Antarctica
* [ISMIP6](https://web.archive.org/web/20210928012622/https://climate-cryosphere.org/mips/ismip6/about) (Ice Sheet Model Intercomparison Project for [CMIP6](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/wgcm-cmip/wgcm-cmip6)) strives to improve projections of sea level rise via  simulations of the evolution of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets under a changing climate, along with a quantification of associated uncertainties
