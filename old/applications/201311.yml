abstract: A new inverse approach to reconstruct distributed bedrock
  topography and simultaneously initialize an ice flow model is
  proposed. The procedure runs PISM multiple times over a prescribed
  period, while being forced with space- and time-dependent climate
  input. After each iteration bed heights are adjusted using
  information of the remaining misfit between observed and modeled
  surface topography. Synthetic experiments with constant-climate
  forcing demonstrate convergence and robustness of the approach.
  Application to Nordenskiöldbreen, Svalbard, forced with height- and
  time-dependent climate input since 1300 AD show a high correlation
  against radar-observed thicknesses. Remaining uncertainties can be
  ascribed to inaccurate model physics, in particular, uncertainty in
  the description of sliding.
