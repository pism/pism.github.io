###### Reminder for authors of PISM-using papers

Please acknowledge the funding that makes PISM possible, and which
supports its continued maintenance and technical support. Include the
sentence \"Development of PISM is supported by NASA grants NNX13AM16G
and NNX13AK27G.\" in the Acknowledgments part of your paper.

If authors do this consistently then it will help to ensure continued
funding of PISM!

For specific suggestions on how to cite the design or justification of
PISM see [this page](:citing_pism).
