Dear PISM users and developers

It's my pleasure to congratulate our software engineer and PISM mastermind Constatine Khroulev to the birth of his son, Alexander (Sasha). Constantine is now on paternity leave and hence I'd like to ask for your patience as answering PISM questions will take longer in the next couple months.

Thank you for your understanding,

Andy
