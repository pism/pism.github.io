title: PISM 2.0 is out
---

PISM developers have been hard at work to bring you a brand new
version of PISM, packed with new features. After years of development,
PISM finally includes a Blatter solver, warranting a new major
version: PISM 2.0.

## Notable changes

### New logo

PISM has a new logo designed by [Julius Garbe](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/members/garbe/).

### New website

The new website at [www.pism.io](https://www.pism.io/) replaces the
[old version](http://web.archive.org/web/20210812174625/https://pism-docs.org/wiki/doku.php).

### Stress balance

- Implemented a [FEM solver for the first order
  approximation](http://www.pism.io/docs/manual/modeling-choices/dynamics/blatter.html)
  of the Stokes equations due to Blatter (1995). This solver supports
  multigrid preconditioners (see Brown et al 2013) and includes 5
  verification test based on manufactured solutions.
- Implemented [experiments A,B,C,D,E from the ISMIP-HOM
  intercomparison](http://www.pism.io/docs/manual/simplified-geometry/ismip-hom.html).
- Fixed the approximation of the driving stress at floating ice margins
  in the
  [SSA](http://www.pism.io/docs/manual/modeling-choices/dynamics/ssa.html)
  solver. (This fix was contributed by Ronja Reese and Torsten
  Albrecht; see [these
  notes](http://www.pism.io/docs/technical/ssafd-flow-line.html) for
  details.)

### Basal strength

- Implemented regularized Coulomb sliding as in Zoet & Iverson, 2020, A slip law for
  glaciers on deformable beds, equation 3.
- Assume that in the "ocean" areas the till at the base is saturated with water, i.e. the
  till water amount is equal to `hydrology.tillwat_max`. This change should improve
  grounding line movement and make the basal yield stress modification turned on with
  `basal_yield_stress.slippery_grounding_lines` unnecessary.
- Implemented a mechanism for "optimizing" the till friction angle used by the Mohr-Coulomb
  yield stress model. The implementation is based on the code contributed by T. Albrecht.

### Bed deformation

- The [new `-bed_def given`
  component](http://www.pism.io/docs/manual/modeling-choices/subglacier/bed-deformation.html#given-bed-deformation-history)
  reads in a prescribed bed deformation history from a file (e.g. from
  a solid-Earth model) relative to a (high-resolution) reference
  topography, indicated by configuration parameter
  `bed_deformation.given.file` and
  `bed_deformation.given.reference_file`, respectively.

### Calving

- Implemented scaling of calving rates using a time-dependent factor.
  Set `calving.rate_scaling.file` to the name of the file containing
  `frac_calving_rate` (units: "1").
- [Ice thickness
  threshold](http://www.pism.io/docs/manual/modeling-choices/marine/calving.html#calving-of-thin-floating-ice)
  read in from `calving.thickness_calving.file` can be both space- and
  time-dependent.

### Fracture density model

- Implemented the [fracture
  density](http://www.pism.io/docs/manual/modeling-choices/marine/damage.html)
  growth parameterization due to Borstad et al (equation 4 in [Borstad
  et al, 2016](http://doi.org/10.1002/2015GL067365)). Code contributed
  by T. Albrecht).

### Atmosphere forcing

- Support [2D precipitation
  scaling](http://www.pism.io/docs/climate_forcing/atmosphere.html#precipitation-scaling)
  in `-atmosphere ...,frac_P`. If the input file set using
  `atmosphere.frac_P.file` contains a scalar time series `frac_P`, use
  that as a time-dependent constant-in-space forcing. If the input
  file contains a 2D variable `frac_P`, use that as a
  time-and-space-dependent forcing.
- Added surface elevation smoothing to the [orographic precipitation
  model](http://www.pism.io/docs/climate_forcing/atmosphere.html#orographic-precipitation).
  High-frequency modes in the surface elevation that can develop in
  runs with evolving ice geometry (consider grounded ice margins) may
  cause oscillations in the computed precipitation field (probably due
  to the Gibbs phenomenon). These oscillations may result in an even
  rougher topography, triggering a feedback loop polluting model
  results. Set
  `atmosphere.orographic_precipitation.smoothing_standard_deviation`
  (in meters) to smooth the ice surface elevation to reduce this
  effect.
- Added `atmosphere.elevation_change.precipitation.temp_lapse_rate` to
  the [`-atmosphere ...,elevation_change`
  modifier](http://www.pism.io/docs/climate_forcing/atmosphere.html#adjustments-using-modeled-change-in-surface-elevation).
  Now this parameter is used to compute the temperature change `dT`
  used to scale precipitation by a factor `exp(C * dT)` with `C =
  atmosphere.precip_exponential_factor_for_temperature`. We need a
  separate temperature lapse rate parameter to be able to use this
  modifier with atmosphere models that include an elevation-dependent
  near-surface air temperature parameterizations, e.g. `-atmosphere
  pik,elevation_change`.

### Ocean forcing

- The [three-equation ocean
  model](http://www.pism.io/docs/climate_forcing/ocean.html#basal-melt-rate-and-temperature-from-thermodynamics-in-boundary-layer)
  `-ocean th` uses constant salinity (see
  `constants.sea_water.salinity`) if `salinity_ocean` is not present
  in the forcing file.
- Added a [new ocean
  modifier](http://www.pism.io/docs/climate_forcing/ocean.html#scalar-melange-back-pressure-offsets):
  `-ocean ...,delta_MBP`. This component reads scalar time-dependent
  melange pressure offsets (units: Pa) and uses them in the calving
  front boundary condition for the SSA.
- Adjusted
  [PICO](http://www.pism.io/docs/climate_forcing/ocean.html#pico)
  ocean input average across covered basins, in which the ice shelf
  has in fact a connection to the ocean. Large ice shelves spanning
  two basins that do not share an ocean boundary are split into two
  separate ice shelf instances. (This code was contributed by Torsten
  Albrecht.)
- Added `sea_level.constant.value`. This sets the default sea level
  elevation used with `-sea_level constant`.
- Removed `ocean.always_grounded`. Set `sea_level.constant.value` to a
  large negative value to ensure that all ice is grounded.
- Removed `ocean.melange_back_pressure_fraction`: it is no longer
  needed.

## Input and output, diagnostics
- Added a new `output.format` value: `netcdf4_serial` and
  `output.compression_level`. Use `-o_format netcdf4_serial
  -output.compression_level N` (`N` between 1 and 9) to write
  compressed NetCDF from rank 0.
- Support writing compressed NetCDF in parallel with NetCDF 4.7.4 or newer and HDF5 1.10.3
  or newer. Set `output.compression_level` to enable compression.
- Stop with an error message if some values of a variable read from a file match the
  `_FillValue` attribute (PISM expects input files to contain data at all grid points
  within the domain).
- Now PISM stops with an error message if time-dependent forcing data read from a file do
  not span the whole length of a simulation. Set `input.forcing.time_extrapolation` to
  "true" to disable this check.
- Removed the configuration parameter `input.forcing.evaluations_per_year`. Now
  the code evaluates *exact* values of time averages of time-dependent forcing inputs.
- Major improvement in the handling of time-dependent forcing. A file containing periodic
  forcing has to contain *exactly* one period. The start and the length of the period are
  derived from time bounds read from this file. This makes it easier to use periodic
  forcing and adds supports for arbitrary period lengths. See the manual section about
  time-dependent inputs.
- All time-dependent forcing files have to contain time bounds.
- Now PISM always respects the reference date in input files.
- Improved the approximation of the grounding line flux (scalar and 2D diagnostics
  `grounding_line_flux`): the flux *through* the grounding line should be zero if its
  direction is parallel to the grounding line. Unfortunately this is impossible to achieve
  for an arbitrary grounding line shape if the grounding line is approximated by a mask on
  a uniform grid (as in PISM). This change improves the approximation for some
  combinations of grounding line shapes and grid resolutions. (This issue was reported by
  Ronja Reese.)

### Model time and time stepping

- Added a new parameter: `time_stepping.resolution`. PISM rounds time step lengths *down* to
  a multiple of this number (default: 1 second). This reduces [the influence of rounding
  errors on time step lengths](https://github.com/pism/pism/issues/407).
- Command-line options `-y`, `-ys`, `-ye`, `-max_dt` and corresponding configuration
  parameters use units of `365 days` instead of `years`. The latter has the meaning of the
  mean tropical year, i.e. the constant used to convert from `1/s` to `1/year`. Use `-y
  1000years`, etc to reproduce the old behavior.
- Fixed a bug in the code managing time step restrictions (this
  affected the last time step of runs using `-skip` and runs with
  `-skip` in which `-max_dt` is active).

### Other

- Added the new command-line option `-refinement_factor N`. Use this
  to select a regional modeling domain using `-x_range ... -y_range
  ...`, then use a grid that is `N` times finer.
- Added support for automatic unit conversion in command-line options.
  If an option argument is a number PISM assumes that it uses PISM's
  internal units. If it is a number followed by a units string
  recognized by UDUNITS it is automatically converted to PISM's
  internal units. For example, the following are equivalent: `-Lz
  1000`, `-Lz 1000m`, `-Lz 1km`.
- Added a new NetCDF variable `thk_bc_mask` prescribing locations
  where the ice thickness is kept fixed. This mask is combined with
  `vel_bc_mask`: we keep ice thickness fixed at all the locations
  where the sliding (usually SSA) velocity is fixed.
- Renamed NetCDF variables `bc_mask` to `vel_bc_mask` and `u_ssa_bc`
  and `v_ssa_bc` to `u_bc` and `v_bc`.
- Removed the `pisms` executable. Run `pismr -eisII X` to run
  [EISMINT-II](http://www.pism.io/docs/manual/simplified-geometry/eismint-2.html)
  experiment `X`.
- `fill_missing_petsc.py` uses homogeneous Neumann BC at domain boundaries.
- Added optional arguments `time_units` and `calendar` to
  `PISM.util.prepare_output()` in the Python bindings.
