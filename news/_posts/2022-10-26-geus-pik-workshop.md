Over 15 reseachers from [GEUS](https://eng.geus.dk), [(PIK)](http://www.pik-potsdam.de), [(Aarhus University)](https://www.au.dk), [(DMI)](http://www.dmi.dk) and [(UAF)](https://www.uaf.edu) attendend the first joint GEUS-PIK PISM workshop at GEUS. The participants presented their latest PISM and PISM-adjacent research interspersed with lively discussions  which data sets could be used for model initialization, calibrations and validation, how can we detect tipping points, what are the best practices to initialize PISM, and which physical processes are currently missing. The discussions continued during a visit to the GEUS roof where Nanna showed us the GEUS weather station and during the workshop dinner. Many started dreaming about joining field work in Greenland some day.
