title: "MPI-GEA: PhD position on the interaction of ice sheets, ocean and sea level"
---

In the department of Integrative Earth system science at the newly founded [Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology (MPI-GEA)](https://www.gea.mpg.de) in Jena, Germany, we are providing a three-year PhD position as part of the [DFG priority program "Antarctic Research with Comparative Investigations in Arctic Ice Areas"](https://www.spp-antarktisforschung.uni-rostock.de/en).

We are looking for a highly motivated candidate, interested in working in an interdisciplinary research team, with a focus on the interaction and possible feedbacks between the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets via the Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and relative sea-level change in a warming climate. Numerical model simulations with PISM coupled to the global solid Earth and sea level model VILMA and the ocean model MOM will be used to investigate tipping characteristics and potential inter-hemispheric effects.

The position will start on 01 January 2025 or as soon as possible afterwards.
Application deadline: 03 November 2024
