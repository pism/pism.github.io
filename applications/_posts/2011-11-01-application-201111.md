| **Location** | Greenland (paleo) ice sheet |

A study of the extent of the Greenland ice sheet during the Mid-Pliocene Warmth (3.3--3.0 Ma), its advance across the continental shelf during the late Pliocene to early Pleistocene glaciations (3.0--2.4 Ma) as implied by offshore geological studies, and the transition from glacial to interglacial conditions around 2.4 Ma as deduced from the deposits of the Kap KÃ¸benhavn Formation, North Greenland.
