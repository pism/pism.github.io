# A brief history of PISM

### Before 2001:

* First approach of a (nominally Antarctic) ice-sheet model by Craig Lingle
* Elena Suleimani (née Troshina) improves model based on Mahaffey’s equations and other numerical methods
* Accuracy test against the analytical solution for a circular ice cap on a flat bed with constant accumulation and for *CLIMAP* reconstruction of the Antarctic ice sheet (20 kyr BP)
* Model equations transformed to forms with a stretched vertical coordinate in Fortran 90 (3-D temperature equation not stable yet)
* First paper on *“Relative magnitudes of shear and longitudinal strain rates in the inland Antarctic ice sheet, and response to increasing accumulation”* by [Lingle and Troshina (1998)](https://doi.org/10.3189/1998AoG27-1-187-193)

### 2001: A team forms

* Lingle attends talk by Ed Bueler on heat equations on manifolds with potential application to glacier models
* Short course by Lingle on glaciological basics, with Bueler, Latrice Bowman, Jed Brown, and Dave Covey in attendance at various points
* Application for NASA model-development funding with Bueler and Covey as Co-Is, to build an Antarctic model which added thermo-mechanical coupling and ice-shelf dynamics to the existing Fortran model, as a modeling component (sub-grant) of the U Kansas *“Polar Radar for Ice Sheet Measurements” (PRISM)* project
* Paper on understanding numerical models by checking them against exact predictions (solutions) of the differential equations: [Bueler et al. (2005)](https://doi.org/10.3189/172756505781829449)
* Bowman first graduate student to work on ice flow with Bueler

### 2003: PETSc and C++ ... and PISM

* Brown (as undergraduate) reports about [PETSc](https://petsc.org/release) library that allows to work in parallel at a higher conceptual level, requiring switch to C++
* Brown and Bueler define object classes and rebuild isothermal SIA model, with under-development thermomechanical coupling code
* Bueler adds thermocoupling to the SIA with Brown and Lingle assistance, and emphasizing exact solutions to check: [Bueler et al. (2007)](https://doi.org/10.3189/002214307783258396)
* Brown adds and tests a SSA solver in PISM, leading to successful [MS project defense](http://pism.github.io/uaf-iceflow/slidesJBrown.pdf) in August 2006
* [NetCDF](http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is adopted as the input/output format (instead of PETSc binary files that lack included and standardized metadata)
* Bueler suggests model name *“the C-plus-plus Object-oriented Multi-Modal, Verifiable Numerical Ice Sheet Model”*, a.k.a. *COMMVNISM*
* Brown proposes new name *“Parallel Ice Sheet Model”*, short *PISM*

### 2006: PISM goes public

* In September 2006, PISM is for the first time hosted publicly on [Gna!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gna!) with a [GNU General Public License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License) (later moved to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/))

### 2007: PISM gets ice streams

* Application of SSA solver also to ice streams in near-Coulomb basal drag regime in thermo-coupled context after Bueler reading [Schoof’s (2006) isothermal paper](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0022112006009591)
* Convex combination of two reasonable stress-balance solutions (i.e. SIA+SSA)
* Participation in [*ISMIP-HEINO*](https://doi.org/10.3189/002214310792447789) proves that SIA is not sufficient to balance transitions in boundary shear stress with “membrane stresses” within the ice, supporting SSA-everywhere approach and having [ice streams in the model for the right reasons](http://pism.github.io/uaf-iceflow/talkagu.pdf) as the core of PISM
* Most cited PISM-related paper by [Bueler and Brown (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1029/2008JF001179)

### 2008: New team

* New proposal to a NASA Modeling, Analysis, and Prediction call, based on a team of Bueler, Constantine Khroulev, mathematician David Maxwell, and glaciologists Martin Truffer and Regine Hock, is funded
* Khroulev starts in spring 2008 after finishing his MS Math, producing [startlingly-complete Antarctic results in Fall 2008 at the WAIS conference](http://pism.github.io/uaf-iceflow/khroulev_final.pdf)
* Nearly-untuned results for Greenland [match observations reasonably well](http://pism.github.io/uaf-iceflow/BKAJS_submit2_twocolumn.pdf)

### 2008: PIK collaboration

* Anders Levermann and students (Maria Martin and Ricarda Winkelmann) from PIK come to Fairbanks to propose a collaboration in which they would add what PISM needed for applications to the Antarctic Ice Sheet (ability to move the calving front and the grounding line)
* Model description paper by [Winkelmann et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.5194/tc-5-715-2011)
* Andy Aschwanden is hired as an *ARSC* PostDoc in Fall 2009, implementing an [enthalpy formulation](https://doi.org/10.3189/2012JoG11J088)

### 2011: PISM goes viral
